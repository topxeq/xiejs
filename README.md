# xiejs

Xielang is a free, open-source, cross-platform, cross-language, embeddable, ASM-like scripting language written by TopXeQ. This is the JavaScript version, i.e. running on the VM written in JavaScript. A crazy idea, isn't it?

See the index.html for the usage. For more info, please visit the [official website](http://xie.topget.org), or the [document page](http://xie.topget.org/xiejs.html)(both in Chinese currently). There is a playground in the homepage as well.
